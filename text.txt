They serve the purpose of changing hydrogen into breathable oxygen.And they are as necessary here as the air is, on Earth.But I still say, they are flowers.If you like...Do you sell them?I am afraid not.But, maybe we could make a deal?What do you mean?Oh, you see, you will not have to send them anywhere. I will pay for them, and then, I will leave them here, for you.
